Project Description:

Data analysis of COVID-19 in Canada including an overview of various metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination success and more. 

Research Questions to Answer:

1. Infection rates per province, include comparison across all provinces (major provinces first). Look what we have in the data.
2. Vaccination rates per province and their success rate? Linear regression between infected patients vs vaccinated - make sure to add provinces, depending on data. Small terriotories wonâ€™t have enough data.
3. Mortality rate per provinces, Infection rates by age, recovery rate: include sex rate: females and males. 
4. Hospitalization rates across all provinces
